# Working thumbor-s3/riak setup, you can drop all capabilities in docker
# just change some parameters, like the TC_AWS_ENDPOINT, start docker with the vault token and environment
# and test:  curl http://thumbor-s3:9990/unsafe/fit-in/220x220/filters:fill(white)/bucket-name/path/123.jpg
# you can later auto-add the bucket name in nginx, using map and rewrite.
# after tests, you can secure thumbor by disabling ALLOW_UNSAFE_URL
# Based on the work by Lu√≠s Almeida and tcaxias
